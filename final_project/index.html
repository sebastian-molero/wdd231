            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>At <strong>A New Companion</strong>, we believe that every pet deserves a loving home — whether they come from a rescue, a trusted family, or a safe and responsible environment.</p>
            <p>Our mission is to connect people with pets in meaningful ways, by making the adoption process transparent, compassionate, and stress-free. We work with families, individual pet owners, and small community networks to ensure pets find the right match — not just any home, but the <em>right</em> one.</p>
            <p>We're here to support both humans and animals — offering tips, tools, and heartfelt guidance through every step of the journey. Because bringing home a pet isn't just about adopting — it's about welcoming a companion who will change your life.</p>

            <p>Your trust matters. That's why we're committed to honesty, compassion, and doing what’s best — for both pets and people.</p>
